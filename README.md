Developing and working from a Service Level Agreement benefits both internal suppliers and internal customers by providing:

-Cross-functional perspectives: Teams learn about the work or each other.  It provide an ongoing “cross-functional training” experience.
-Agreements: It documents actionable expectations, needs, and requests.
-Two -Way Approach: It establishes a mutual interdependent relationship.
-Action Plan: It provides rules of engagement teams use to work together.
-Feedback: Suppliers received ongoing feedback about their success --- as opposed to after delivering a service to the internal customer. 

This Service Level Agreement guides the relationship so that both teams work collaboratively for the benefit of bottom-line business results.
